    <h3>Lichess Profile: <a href="https://lichess.org/@/TheLastStyleBender/blog">TheLastStylebender</a></h3>
    <p><strong>This test was designed for anyone to quickly determine
       which openings best suit them based off of their personalities relating to 4 particular questions.
       The questions are purposefully open-ended - if you get stuck, select the answer which feels most like ‘you’.
